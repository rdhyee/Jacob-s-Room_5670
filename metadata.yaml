description: "Jacob's Room is the third novel by Virginia Woolf, first published on\
  \ 26 October 1922.\nThe novel centres, in a very ambiguous way, around the life\
  \ story of the protagonist Jacob Flanders and is presented almost entirely through\
  \ the impressions other characters have of Jacob. Thus, although it could be said\
  \ that the book is primarily a character study and has little in the way of plot\
  \ or background, the narrative is constructed with a void in place of the central\
  \ character if, indeed, the novel can be said to have a 'protagonist' in conventional\
  \ terms.\nMotifs of emptiness and absence haunt the novel and establish its elegiac\
  \ feel. Jacob is described to us, but in such indirect terms that it would seem\
  \ better to view him as an amalgam of the different perceptions of the characters\
  \ and narrator. He does not exist as a concrete reality, but rather as a collection\
  \ of memories and sensations.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
